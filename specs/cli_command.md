# Implementation Plan for AI Development Project Boilerplate Creation

## Goal
The goal is to implement a CLI command that creates a boilerplate for a project. The cli command should be created similar like starting a nextjs project, react project, ...

## AI Development Project Structure

The AI Development Project Structure is defined in the [AI Development Project Structure](ai_docs/ai_dev_folder_structure.md) document. Only the folders needs to be created when running the command and not the files.

## Command Description

First, the CLI tool needs to be installed. The CLI tool can be called 'aidev'. When the CLI tool is installed, a user can run the command 'aidev init' within their existing project folder to create the AI Development Project structure directly in the current directory. The user will be prompted with a single confirmation to proceed with initializing the project structure in the current folder. If they decline, the process stops and they are prompted to create a project folder first. This is the MVP.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core CLI Setup
1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Create Node.js project with TypeScript
   - Set up package.json with CLI bin configuration
   - Configure build system (esbuild/rollup for distribution)
   - Add shebang for executable CLI

2. **CLI Framework Integration**
   - Use commander.js for argument parsing and command structure
   - Set up main CLI entry point (`src/cli.ts`)
   - Configure command registration system

3. **Core Command Implementation**
   - Implement `aidev init` command
   - Detect current working directory
   - Add single confirmation prompt to initialize in current folder
   - Exit gracefully with instructions if user declines

### Phase 2: Directory Creation Logic
1. **Folder Structure Generator**
   - Create folder creation utility functions
   - Implement the standard AI development structure in current working directory:
     ```
     ./
     ├── .claude/
     │   └── commands/
     ├── ai_docs/
     ├── specs/
     └── README.md (basic template)
     ```

3. **Error Handling**
   - Handle permission errors
   - Handle existing directory conflicts
   - Provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions

### Phase 3: User Experience
1. **Interactive Prompts**
   - Single confirmation: "Initialize AI development structure in current directory? (y/N)"
   - If declined: Display message "Please create a project folder and run 'aidev init' from within it"
   - No other user inputs required

2. **Logging and Feedback**
   - Progress indicators during folder creation
   - Success messages with created structure overview
   - Helpful next steps guidance

### Phase 4: Distribution and Installation
1. **Package Configuration**
   - Configure npm package for global installation
   - Set up proper bin linking
   - Add installation instructions

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for folder creation logic
   - Integration tests for full command flow
   - Test on different operating systems

### Phase 5: Documentation and Enhancement
1. **Documentation**
   - CLI usage documentation
   - Installation guide

2. **Future Enhancements** (Post-MVP)
   - Custom templates support
   - Configuration file support
   - Integration with git initialization
   - Support for different project types

### Technical Implementation Details

**Dependencies:**
- `commander`: CLI argument parsing
- `inquirer`: Interactive prompts
- `chalk`: Terminal colors/styling
- `fs-extra`: Enhanced file system operations

**File Structure:**
```
src/
├── cli.ts          # Main CLI entry point
├── commands/
│   └── init.ts     # Init command implementation
├── utils/
│   ├── fileSystem.ts  # Folder creation utilities
│   ├── templates.ts   # Template file content
│   └── prompts.ts     # User interaction utilities
└── types/
    └── index.ts    # TypeScript type definitions
```

**Build Process:**
1. TypeScript compilation
2. Bundle for distribution
3. Generate executable with proper permissions
4. Package for npm distribution
