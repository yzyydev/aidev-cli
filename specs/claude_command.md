# Claude Command Specification

## Overview
The `aidev claude` command provides a seamless way to launch Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI tool. It automatically handles installation if Claude Code is not already present on the system.

## Command
```bash
aidev claude
```

## Functionality

### 1. Installation Check
- Check if Claude Code is installed globally by attempting to run `claude --version`
- If the command exists and returns a version, Claude Code is installed
- If the command fails or is not found, Claude Code needs to be installed

### 2. Installation Process
If Claude Code is not installed:
- Install Claude Code globally using npm: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- Verify successful installation
- Display installation success message

### 3. Launch Claude Code
After confirming Claude Code is installed:
- Execute `claude` command to start Claude Code
- Pass control to Claude Code for user interaction

## Implementation Requirements

### Prerequisites Check
- Verify Node.js 18+ is installed (required for Claude Code)

- Ensure system meets Claude Code requirements:
  - macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 20.04+/Debian 10+, or Windows via WSL
  - 4GB RAM minimum
  - Internet connection for authentication

### Error Handling
- Handle npm permission errors gracefully
- Provide clear error messages for missing prerequisites
- Suggest solutions for common installation issues
- Handle WSL-specific installation problems

### User Experience
- Show installation progress indicators
- Provide clear feedback during each step
- Minimal user interaction required
- Seamless transition to Claude Code interface

## Expected Behavior

1. **First-time users**: Command will install Claude Code and launch it
2. **Existing users**: Command will directly launch Claude Code
3. **Failed installation**: Display error message with troubleshooting guidance
4. **Permission issues**: Suggest alternative installation methods

## Exit Codes
- `0`: Success (Claude Code launched successfully)
- `1`: Installation failed
- `2`: Prerequisites not met
- `3`: Launch failed

## Integration
This command integrates with the existing aidev CLI structure and follows the same patterns as other commands in the `/src/commands/` directory.
